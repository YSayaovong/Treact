# Treact – My React Landing Page Project

This repository contains my work building a modern landing page using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The focus of this project was to strengthen my **front-end development skills** while practicing reusable components, responsive design, and clean code organization.

---

## 📌 What I Did

- Set up a new **React project** and configured it with **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.  
- Designed and built **reusable components** such as the header, hero section, features section, pricing cards, FAQ, and footer.  
- Implemented a **responsive layout** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Added **interactive elements** like a mobile navigation menu and FAQ accordion.  
- Organized the project into a clear folder structure (`components/`, `pages/`, `styles/`).  
- Customized **styling, spacing, and typography** through the `tailwind.config.js` file.  
- Tested accessibility features by ensuring semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where needed, and proper color contrast.  
- Practiced deployment readiness by generating a **production build**.
